# Changelog

## v0.3.0, yyyy-mm-dd

### Changes

* Add support for wildcards in engine versions, e.g. `5.4.*` selects the
  latest available version of PHP 5.4. Staying up to date has never been easier!
* Made document root overridable for Symfony apps
* Rebuilt 5.5, 5.4.19 and 5.3.27 to include the [phpredis][], mongo, exif,
  readline, sockets and bcmath extensions.
* Enable extensions in the `.ini` files distributed with the binaries.
* Added `php-includes` config directive for `composer.json` for
  including additional PHP config files.
* PHP, NGINX and Composer binaries are now cached and revalidated
  against MD5 hashes. This should provide notably faster deployments.

## v0.2.0, 2013-09-03

### Changes

* Buildpack now works also only with an `index.php` in the project's

* Changed the default PHP to 5.5.3
* Add `nginx-includes` config key to include custom NGINX config files.
* Add the special `default` specifier for engine versions
* New structure for NGINX configurations. All shared config (like port,
  etc.) is now in one shared file, framework configurations are now
  included into the `server` scope.
