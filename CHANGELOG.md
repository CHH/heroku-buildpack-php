# Changelog

## v0.2.0, ????-??-??

### Changes

* Buildpack now works also only with an `index.php` in the project's
  root, without `composer.json`. This makes it possible to run apps
  which are built for the official Heroku PHP buildpack.
* Packaging scripts now use zlib package from S3 bucket

## v0.1.1, 2013-07-05

### Changes

* PHP 5.5.0 is the new default
* Added PHP 5.4.17

## v0.1.0

### Upgrading:

* APC was removed in favor of Zend Opcache. All PHP versions from 5.3 to
  5.5 now use Zend Opcache for Opcaching. If you want to keep running
with APC, set the PHP version in the engines to either 5.3.25 or 5.4.15,
and add `extension=apc.so` to your `php-config`.

### Changes

* Added 5.3.26, 5.4.16, 5.5.0
* Added `buildpack.conf` to easily customize buildpack settings when
  forked
* Add Opcache settings
* Using Zend Opcache for all PHP builds, leads to better performance and
  is an uniform solution from 5.3 to 5.5
